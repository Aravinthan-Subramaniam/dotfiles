OSX terminal rc files

## `oh-my-zsh`

This file relies on [this awesome utility](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) to be installed. Well, maybe not relies on but it's nice to have it installed. 

Installed plugins
 * adb
 * git
 * lol
 * osx
 * sublime

Uses the [ys](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#ys) theme. 

## `vim`

Uses [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as the package manager. 

Uses the [onedark](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/onedark-vim) syntax theme and the [Emmet.vim](http://vimawesome.com/plugin/emmet-vim) and [vim-javascript](http://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-javascript) plugins for language. 

## `tmux`

The `.tmux.conf` file sets some shortcuts and a theme for `tmux`. This has been tested on tmux version 2.6 and newer.
